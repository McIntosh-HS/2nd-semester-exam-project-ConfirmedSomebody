                    Overall, my experience with IST was very nice. Learning new things, how to code, and most importantly, making annoying and and absolutley the best friends ever. My experience was something I could never forget.

                    Learning binary was really cool. On top of learning a new language in hish school (Spanish) <i>and</i> learning this makes me multilingual at this point. 
                    <br>
                    The next thing we learned about was the programming language called C. Apparently, everybody hated it, and was quickly forgotten, (to be honest, i forgot most of it too) but it was still cool to write and learn about it in the first place.
                    <br>
                    Last but not least, we learned about HTML. HTML is the sole reason this website was made possible, and it could not exist without IST. This course taught me how to make, style and format a website, and I could not have been more satisfied.
